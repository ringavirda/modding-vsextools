mods loaded together.

  -Mod            one or more mods/samples to check, comma-separated (default: every mod built)
  -Version <x.y>  the game series to check against (default: 1.22)
  -Configuration  the build configuration to read (default: Debug)
  -Strict         an informational finding fails the run too, not only an error
  -Json           ExlibVerify's own --json report instead of its plain-text one

exmod codes <exlib|iiex|siex>

Regenerates one mod's {Mod}Blocks.g.cs from its code-first block definitions. There is no separate
emitter tool: builds the mod, runs its test project with EXLIB_WRITE_BLOCKCODES=1 in the
environment and --filter "exmod=codes" (the trait every mod's *BlocksCodeTests class carries, so
one filter reaches whichever mod is asked for), then rebuilds - so a table that no longer compiles
fails here rather than in the next test run.

Takes a mod id from exmod.json's mods, or a sample id if its test project carries a test with that
trait - none of the samples do today, so `codes <sample>` reports it has nothing to regenerate.

One command that answers "is this tree good". Runs format -Check, build, verify, then test, in
that order, stopping at the first failing step. Ends with a PASS/FAIL/SKIPPED summary of every
step and exits nonzero if any of them did.

  latest      1.22 only (the default), for the build and test steps
  all         every supported series, for the build and test steps
  -Coverage   passed through to the test step, in place of its own per-version lanes
  -NoFormat   skip the format step outright. It is also skipped, for a different reason, when
              mods/ or infra/ already has uncommitted changes - the format gate compares against
              git, so on a dirty tree every finding would be one of your own edits, not a real one.
