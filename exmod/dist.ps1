Builds every mod for every supported game version and zips one archive per (game version, mod) into

mod icon, a modinfo whose game dependency is rewritten to that version, and LICENSE.txt.

Assets are taken from the publish output rather than from the source tree, because each game
version filters its own (a legacy-only patch whose codes do not resolve on a newer version is
removed there and nowhere else).

Builds the developer bundle - exlib-testing_<version>.zip - and leaves it beside the mod zips in

both XML documentation files, the source generators under analyzers/, LICENSE.txt and a README
explaining how to reference them from a test project outside this repo.

The harness is a developer library rather than a game mod, so it is not a mod zip. It is built for
the current game version only; on 1.21 and 1.20 a consumer references it from source.

Packs the projects this repository's exmod.json names under `packages` into dist/nuget (or

Each packable project reads its own version from exmod.json, so a release bumps one number for
all of them. Nothing here pushes to NuGet.org: that is a separate decision, taken by release.yml's
push step, which is gated on the NUGET_USER repository variable rather than commented out.
