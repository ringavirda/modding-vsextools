  dotnet   a self-contained SDK plus every runtime major the requested series need (net10 for 1.22,

           .dotnet/dotnet, because the global muxer ignores DOTNET_ROOT and cannot see them.

  game     a Vintage Story install under .game/<series>. -Kind server (the default) takes the
           dedicated-server archive, which carries every assembly the build and the tests need and
           needs no game licence; -Kind client takes the full client, to play in. A server request
           never overwrites a client that can already serve - it lands in .game/<series>-server
           instead. -Version takes a full patch (1.22.3) or a series (1.22, its latest patch).

  mods     every runtime dependency this repo does not build itself (game and this repo's own mods
           and samples never count): a workspace sibling's build output, else a cached extraction
           under .exmod/mods/<id>, else a fresh download into it - exmod.json's depends.<id>.url or
           .github when named, else the ModDB API. Prints what it resolved and from where, or says

dependency mods (see `exmod provision mods`), and restores the solution.

Defaults to the current series and the dedicated-server archive, which carries every assembly the

Nothing here is a precondition: every command provisions what it needs on demand. This only does
